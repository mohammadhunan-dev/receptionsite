DESCRIPTION:Attire: We want all our guests to feel comfortable and stylish, so you're welcome to wear either traditional South Asian attire, such as Salwar Kameez, Lehenga, Sherwani, etc or more Western-style clothing like an American suit or dress. Please choose whatever suits your personal style! We kindly ask that guests **avoid wearing red**, as it is traditionally reserved for the bride. We're excited to see everyone looking their best as we celebrate together!
